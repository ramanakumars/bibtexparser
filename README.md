# bibtexparser
Parses .bib entries into plaintext/HTML entries or clean up the .bib file. Currently hosted [here](https://ramanakumars.com/bibtexparser/).

# Usage

## Requirements
This is a React TypeScript app bundled using webpack. To build this locally, you will need [node](https://nodejs.org/en)/[yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/). This README uses node, but you can swap in `yarn` as needed.

## Building and running the app
To build the React App, run the following from the root folder:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

You can then launch this app using a static hoster of your choice. You can also run the development build using `npm run start` instead of building the app.
