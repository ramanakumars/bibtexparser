    abstract = "{The Great Dark Spot (GDS-89) observed by Voyager 2 was the first of several large-scale vortices observed on Neptune, the most recent of which was observed in 2018 in the Northern hemisphere (NDS-2018). Ongoing observations of these features are constraining cloud formation, drift, shape oscillations, and other dynamic properties. In order to effectively model these characteristics, an explicit calculation of methane cloud microphysics is needed. Using an updated version of the Explicit Planetary Isentropic Coordinate General Circulation Model (EPIC GCM) and its active cloud microphysics module to account for the condensation of methane, we investigate the evolution of large-scale vortices on Neptune. We model the effect of methane deep abundance and cloud formation on vortex stability and dynamics. In our simulations, the vortex shows a sharp contrast in methane vapour density inside compared to outside the vortex. Methane vapour column density is analogous to optical depth and provides a more consistent tracer to track the vortex, so we use that variable over potential vorticity. We match the meridional drift rate of the GDS and gain an initial insight into the evolution of vortices in the Northern hemisphere, such as the NDS-2018.}",

    abstract = "{On 2019 August 7, an impact flash lasting ∼1 s was observed on Jupiter. The video of this event was analysed to obtain the light curve, and determine the energy release and initial mass. We find that the impactor released a total energy of 96–151 kilotons of TNT, corresponding to an initial mass between 190 and 260 metric tonnes with a diameter between 4 and 10 m. We developed a fragmentation model to simulate the atmospheric breakup of the object and reproduce the light curve. We model three different materials: cometary, stony, and metallic at speeds of 60, 65, and 70 km s−1, respectively, to determine the material make-up of the impacting object. The slower cases are best fitted by a strong, metallic object while the faster cases require a weaker material.}",
